    "- Loading and naming a module\n",
    "- Using a module \n",
    "- Making a module \n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading and naming a module\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a python script compiled to a file with the extension .py and can be used via the key work **import** <br>\n",
    "The syntax for importing a file<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "using the keyword **from** we specify the imported is in a specific folder and with **as** we can save the <br> python module under a different alias.<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import filename from foldername as fn \n",
    "```\n",
    "The module is now ready for use and you can access function defined in **filename.py** <br>\n",
    "This also ensure we dont always need to import a whole directory, but maybe a part of it<br><br>\n",
    "The structure of your python script is made so you can only see what is in the same level and folder the script is placed<br>\n",
    "or online resources made availble by Pythons online libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a module\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is made availble through the previos section you can start using the functions defined in the module as:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    myvar = fn.Function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case we have a function in module with the alias **fn** called function and we which to use it and save it to **myvar**<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a module\n",
    "You can write your own modules by downloading your project as an .py extended file. you can as any other module put it en the same folder and access it directly <br>\n",
    "The benefit is that we can fastly **import** and reuse our own or different modules fast as the filename defines the which module we are using.<br>\n",
    "To make a module we can **def**ine functions and include other directories:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    #filename.py\n",
    "    import otherDirectory from otherFolder as od\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def Function();\n",
    "        print(\"Function is called\")\n",
    "        value = od.otherFunction()\n",
    "        return value\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "The **function()** will be made available by importing filename.py and using the alias we set for the module in section 2.<br>\n",
    "The way to use **def** is to name the function with parameter values needed, then you indent the operation you wish to execute. the ident defines eveything to be executed and will fail execution. As this is an interpreted code luanguage we will only fail when we call the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    #filename.py\n",
    "    import otherDirectory from otherFolder as od\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def Function();\n",
    "        print(\"Function is called\")\n",
    "        value = od.otherFunction()\n",
