The confusion matrix utilizes multiple equations to value the algorithms prediction purely on statisical data.   
Through this exercise we have gone through some of ways of testing: accuracy, sensitivity and precision.
This helps us understand the different factors of the algorithm, it might have a high accuracy but if its 
isnt also reflected in the sensitivity part of the confusion matrix, then we need to re-evaluate the approach.  
These techniques will help us understand how our algorithm behaves on data, as our algorithm might have an 
unbalanced prediction and help us spot if our algorithm is biased towards any data.
We see through this exercise that we need human intuition to decode some of the result from the confusion matrix 
and how to improve the algorithms prediction.
The examples in these exercises are controlled and we have a target value to hit with our algorithms, 
but when we start our project its nice to go through what values we can expect and se how our values can trick us.
